### :keyboard: Activity: Open the project in GitHub Codespaces

Welcome to the Copilot Bootcamp! In this first step, you'll set up your development environment using GitHub Codespaces, which provides a complete, cloud-hosted development environment right in your browser.

### What is GitHub Codespaces?

**GitHub Codespaces** is a cloud development environment that allows you to:
- Code directly in your browser without any local setup
- Access a fully configured Visual Studio Code environment
- Run and test your applications in the cloud
- Work from any device with an internet connection

Having a consistent development environment ensures all bootcamp participants have the same experience, regardless of their local machine setup.

### :keyboard: Activity: Launch a Codespace for this repository

1. Click on the **Code** button at the top of the repository page.

2. Select the **Codespaces** tab in the dropdown menu.

3. Click on the **Create codespace on main** button.

4. Wait for your codespace to start. This may take a few moments as GitHub sets up a fresh development environment for you.

5. When the codespace is ready, you'll see a Visual Studio Code interface in your browser. This environment includes:
   - All required dependencies pre-installed
   - The project code already cloned and ready to use
   - VS Code extensions needed for the bootcamp pre-configured

6. Explore the environment by opening the Explorer panel (click the files icon in the left sidebar) and navigating through the project structure.

### Success Criteria

To complete this activity successfully:
- You should see a VS Code interface in your browser
- The terminal should show that all dependencies are installed
- The Explorer panel should display the project's file structure
- The bottom status bar should indicate that you're connected to a codespace

Once your codespace is up and running, you're ready to proceed to the next step of the bootcamp!

### :bulb: Tip: Making the most of Codespaces

- You can customize your codespace by adjusting VS Code settings
- The terminal is fully functional and supports all standard commands
- Changes are automatically saved to your codespace
- If you close your browser, your codespace will still be available when you return
